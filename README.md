## Instructions

This is a kanji matching game. The goal is to match each card's icon with its kanji pair (please see legend). There are 8 icons and 8 kanjis respectfully. Click on a card, remember its icon/kanji then continue clicking other cards until you find a match. The game ends once all pairs are matched. However, if your matches are incorrect, a star will be taken away each time. If you are out of stars, the game is over.
